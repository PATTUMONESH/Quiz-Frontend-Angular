It is a highly developed set of instructions that are designed to be executed by the Java runtime system known as Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java programs executed by the JVM that makes the code portable and secure. Because JVM prevents the code from generating its side effects. The Java code is portable, as the same byte code can run on any platform."
